# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Underwater Positioning System (UPS) that adapts GPS principles for underwater environments using the NATO-developed JANUS protocol. The system enables precise 3D positioning for underwater drones, personal navigation devices, and other submerged assets by utilizing acoustic signals from strategically positioned anchor nodes.

The current prototype validates the theoretical feasibility through trilateration algorithms, but the production system must be optimized for deployment on resource-constrained microcontrollers in harsh underwater environments. The system addresses the critical gap in underwater navigation where GPS signals cannot penetrate water beyond shallow depths.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Positioning Functionality

**User Story:** As an underwater drone operator, I want the system to determine my precise 3D position underwater, so that I can navigate accurately and safely complete my mission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives acoustic signals from at least 3 anchor nodes THEN the system SHALL calculate and return a 2D position with estimated depth
2. WHEN the system receives acoustic signals from 4 anchor nodes THEN the system SHALL calculate and return a precise 3D position including depth
3. WHEN anchor nodes are positioned in a non-degenerate geometric configuration THEN the system SHALL achieve positioning accuracy within 1-2 meters
4. WHEN anchor nodes are in a nearly collinear or coplanar configuration THEN the system SHALL still provide a position estimate with reduced accuracy (5-10 meters) and issue appropriate warnings
5. WHEN the calculated position has low confidence due to poor geometry THEN the system SHALL report the estimated accuracy and condition number to the user

### Requirement 2: JANUS Transceiver Interface

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the positioning system to interface cleanly with JANUS transceivers, so that it can receive positioning data from anchor nodes without handling low-level protocol details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interfacing with JANUS transceivers THEN the system SHALL communicate via standard interfaces (UART, I2C, SPI)
2. WHEN receiving data from transceivers THEN the system SHALL parse structured messages containing anchor ID, timestamp, and position data
3. WHEN processing anchor messages THEN the system SHALL handle timing data with millisecond precision as provided by the transceiver
4. WHEN multiple transceivers are connected THEN the system SHALL manage concurrent data streams from different anchor sources
5. WHEN transceiver communication fails THEN the system SHALL detect and report communication errors with specific transceiver identification

### Requirement 3: Microcontroller Optimization

**User Story:** As a hardware engineer, I want the positioning system to run efficiently on resource-constrained microcontrollers, so that it can be deployed in compact underwater devices with limited power and processing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on a microcontroller with limited RAM THEN the system SHALL operate within 32KB of memory usage
2. WHEN performing trilateration calculations THEN the system SHALL complete position calculations within 100 milliseconds
3. WHEN operating on battery power THEN the system SHALL minimize power consumption through efficient algorithms and sleep modes
4. WHEN deployed on embedded systems THEN the system SHALL use fixed-point arithmetic where possible to reduce computational overhead
5. WHEN handling multiple positioning requests THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time performance without blocking operations

### Requirement 4: Environmental Robustness

**User Story:** As an underwater vehicle operator, I want the positioning system to work reliably in various underwater conditions, so that I can depend on it for critical navigation tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operating at different water depths THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust for varying sound speed profiles
2. WHEN acoustic signals are affected by multipath propagation THEN the system SHALL filter and process signals to maintain accuracy
3. WHEN some anchor signals are blocked or degraded THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced anchor count and appropriate accuracy warnings
4. WHEN environmental conditions cause signal delays THEN the system SHALL account for variable acoustic propagation speeds (1450-1550 m/s in seawater)
5. WHEN operating in different water types THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of sound speed parameters

### Requirement 5: Real-time Performance and Safety

**User Story:** As a diver using a personal navigation device, I want positioning updates in real-time with clear accuracy indicators, so that I can make informed navigation decisions for my safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting position updates THEN the system SHALL provide results within 200 milliseconds of receiving all required anchor signals
2. WHEN position accuracy is degraded THEN the system SHALL immediately warn the user with specific accuracy estimates
3. WHEN anchor geometry is insufficient for reliable positioning THEN the system SHALL refuse to provide a position and explain the issue
4. WHEN the system detects inconsistent anchor data THEN the system SHALL flag potentially faulty anchor nodes
5. WHEN operating continuously THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance over extended periods (8+ hours)

### Requirement 6: Data Input and Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to easily configure anchor positions and system parameters, so that I can deploy the system in different operational areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL accept anchor position data in standard geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, depth)
2. WHEN loading anchor configurations THEN the system SHALL validate anchor geometry and warn of potential accuracy issues
3. WHEN updating system parameters THEN the system SHALL allow modification of sound speed, timeout values, and accuracy thresholds
4. WHEN storing configuration data THEN the system SHALL use efficient serialization formats suitable for microcontroller storage
5. WHEN validating input data THEN the system SHALL reject invalid coordinates, negative depths, or impossible timestamp values

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a maintenance technician, I want comprehensive error reporting and diagnostic information, so that I can quickly identify and resolve system issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN anchor signals are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL report specific anchor IDs and signal quality metrics
2. WHEN mathematical calculations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating the cause (singular matrix, invalid geometry, etc.)
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log diagnostic information including computation times and memory usage
4. WHEN operating in debug mode THEN the system SHALL provide detailed intermediate calculation results for troubleshooting
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain operation where possible and gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 8: Coordinate System Support

**User Story:** As a navigation system integrator, I want support for multiple coordinate systems, so that I can integrate the positioning data with existing navigation and mapping systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating positions THEN the system SHALL provide results in both local tangent plane (East-North-Down) and geodetic coordinates
2. WHEN converting between coordinate systems THEN the system SHALL maintain precision within centimeter accuracy for local operations
3. WHEN working with large operational areas THEN the system SHALL handle coordinate system transformations appropriately
4. WHEN interfacing with external systems THEN the system SHALL support standard coordinate formats (WGS84, local grid systems)
5. WHEN operating in different geographic regions THEN the system SHALL account for Earth curvature effects in coordinate transformations
